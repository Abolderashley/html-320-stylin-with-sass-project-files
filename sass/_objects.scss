// This is where major page objects will go.
//
// A hint is look for parts on the page with `id` attributes.
// In original work, there have been what should be objects (or components)
// that have been created using just element names. Refactor them into
// objects or components as makes most sense to you.
//
// Sometimes it makes sense to put each object into it's own partial file.
// Create a directory called `objects` and put each object you find into a partial file
// in that directory (e.g. `objects/_famous.scss`).
//
// Then import them in this file, such as:
//
// @import "objects/famous";
//
// Remember to prefix the partial name (not the directory name!) with an underscore.
