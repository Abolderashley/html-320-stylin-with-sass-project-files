# Exercise 01: Create Sass folder structure

Stop the watcher (Control-C) while you make these changes.

1. Make a new folder (aka directory) in the project root calls "sass".
2. Move the file `css/reset.css` to `sass/reset.scss`
3. Move the file `css/styles.css` to `sass/styles.scss`

Restart the watcher (`npm start`)
