# Exercise 9: Section Features

If we look at what's left in the `_overrides` file, there are two things
that seem to stand out:

1. `#organizations`
2. `#facts`

Let's create objects for these by changing the id into a class and
assigning it to the section.

Note that there are some media queries to take care of as well.
