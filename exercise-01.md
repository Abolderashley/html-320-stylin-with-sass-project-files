# Exercise 01: Create Sass folder structure

1. Make a new folder (aka directory) in the project root calls "sass". 
2. Move the file `css/reset.css` to `sass/reset.scss`
3. Move the file `css/styles.css` to `sass/styles.scss`

You probably need to stop the watcher and restart it -- sometimes it doesn't
detect when a new folder is created.
