# Finding Objects and Components

Going though the overrides file, extract out the style information for
the various page objects and components.

Hint: objects and components are typically named classes. Sometimes,
however, elements have been used as page objects. You should convert
these to proper classes.

To differentiate between objects and components, consider that objects
are generally composed of components, but components may appear in
many objects.
