# Project Files for the "Stylin with Sass" class

This repository contains the project files and exercises you'll be
using during the "Stylin with Sass" class.

** PLEASE, Read the instructions
here carefully all the way through first, then follow them.***

## Requirements

### Git

This course **requires** the use of git to acquire the exercises, so
you **must** have it installed. Go
to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and make
sure you have the latest version for your operating system.

As an added bonus, when you install Git on Windows, you will
get a copy of `git-bash` that you can run all the command
lines we'll be using.

### [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

FIRST: check to see if you already have Node installed. Start a
command line program (`git-bash` on Windows,
Terminal.app on Mac, `xterm` on Linux).

Verify that your `node` and `npm` commands are *new* enough by running
the commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

* your `node` version is at least 6 and
* your `npm` version at least 3.

If you have older versions, or if you get errors trying to run those
programs, then head over to https://nodejs.org/en/download and follow
the instructions for getting the LTS (Long Term Support) version of
node for your computer and follow the instructions to install it.

After you've done that, run the two commands above and make sure they
meet the requirements.

If you're on a Mac, you can get the latest version
via [Homebrew](http://brew.io):

```
$ brew install node
```

or

```
$ brew update node
```

On Windows, there is a similar tool called "Choclaty" but I haven't
tried it.

### Code Editor

Make sure you have a code editor you can use to do the exericses in
class.

We recommend:

* [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

We can help with most problems on these two.

You can also use:

* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (only on a Mac)

If you have a favourite editor not listed, certainly you can use it,
but we might not know how to help if you run into problems with it.

We do **not** recommend anyone use plain old `Notepad.exe` on
Windows.

### Browser

While any of the modern browsers can be used, including Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, or Edge, this class is set up to use Chrome, so make sure you
have it installed. See https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/
to make sure you have a copy of Chrome installed.

Since we'll be doing a lot of CSS-type work, you're going to want to
leave the development tools of the browser open while we work on the
site.
