# Exercise 01: Create Sass folder structure

Stop the watcher (Control-C) if it is running.

After checking out this branch (ex.01.start), create a new working
branch and push it to your repo:

    git checkout -b ex.01.work
    git push -u origin ex.01.work

Do this *before* you make any changes.

In this exercise, you'll create files for Sass to compile.

## Steps:

2. Move the file `css/reset.css` to `sass/reset.scss`
3. Move the file `css/styles.css` to `sass/styles.scss`

**NOTE:** the file extension changes!!

Restart the watcher (`npm start`).

If you like what you see, you can save your changes!

    git add --all -v
    git commit -m 'my work on exercise 1'
    git push
