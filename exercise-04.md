# Variables and Settings

Extract and replace constants from the overrides file and turn them
into variables in the settings file.

## Tips:

Look for things like colours, repeated values, font declarations.

Give variables useful and memorable names. `$lightGrey` is less useful
than `$brandBackground`, for example. Variable names should imply how
they are used.
